Hi there!

Thanks for visiting the MiTask GitHub. This is a personal project still under construction, and since I am not currently working with any other contributors, commits are somewhat sparse. Once I've added some more features, I'm hoping to make some changes that will allow everybody to download and enjoy MiTask as much as I do! Enjoy looking through my code!
